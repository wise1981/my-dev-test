The amounts of any deductions that change from payday to payday, and what the deductions are for. These are known as variable deductions. They include tax and National Insurance.
The total amount of any fixed deductions. These are deductions that don’t change from payday to payday – for example, union dues. An employer doesn’t have to give details of what these deductions are for, if they give a separate statement with these details at least once a year.
The amount and method of any part payment. For example, separate figures of a cash payment and the balance credited to a bank account.
Since April 2019, your payslip should include the number of hours worked if your pay varies by the amount of time worked.
Your employer might include extra information on your payslip which they don’t have to provide. For example, your:

tax code
National Insurance number
pay rate (annual or hourly)
extra payments, such as overtime, tips or bonuses. These must be included in your gross pay figure.
